Readme for PAMaerial project. Written by Danielle Harris, edited 04 Nov 2024.

Several data files are required to run the analysis script, several of which are stored at the links below.

(1) DAS data and (2) control/impact shape files:

Data are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cf04g. 

Williamson, L.D., Brookes, K.L., Scott, B.E., Graham, I.M., Bradbury, G., Hammond, P.S. and Thompson, P.M. (2016). Echolocation detections and digital video surveys provide reliable estimates of the relative density of harbour porpoises. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 7: 762-769. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12538

(3) PAM locations:

Thompson P.M., Brookes K.L., Graham I.M., Barton T.R., Needham K., Bradbury G., Merchant N.D. (2013). Short-term disturbance by a commercial two-dimensional seismic survey does not lead to long-term displacement of harbour porpoises.

(4) CPOD detections are included as a file in the GitHub repository. Note that this file requires some formatting in Step 5 in the code. This step could be simplified by providing a file with the number of PPS per CPOD per day across the required time period.
